1. Attached zip contains 4 files/folders
	a. Reverse_Proxy (folder - final Eclipse project)
	b. SocketTest3 (folder- TCP testing tool)
	c. RevProxy.bat (Batch file to run)
	d. RevProxy.jar (runnable jar file used in Batch file)
	
2. To run application. Directly run RevProxy.bat file on Windows
3. Applcation listens on TCP socket (localhost:6789) and forward transformed data to (localhost:6788)
4. Tag1 starts with char < and ends with >. Anything between < and > is replaced by predefined text "TAG1". < and > is retained in output.
5. Tag2 starts with char [ and ends with ]. Anything between [ and ] is converted to lowercase. [ and ] is retained in output.
6. Values in 3,4 and5 above can be configured in proxy.properties file (in Eclipse project). This will need rebuilding of jar.
7. Default proxy.properties looks like {host=localhost,port=6789,fwd_host=localhost,fwd_port=6788,tag1=<,tag1end=>,tag2=[,tag2end=],tag1text=TAG1}
8. A JUnit class AllTests.java is included to verify data transformation (no tests for connection)
9. Application transform the data as per given requirement. Sample input "ABC<XX>DE[Yy]FG<ZZ>HI" -> "ABC<TAG1>DE[yy]FG<TAG1>HI"
10. Logs are logged using Log4J. Logging level is INFO, can be changed in log4j.properties file

Assumption:
1. Tag start and end is of type char only
2. Max input byte array size is 1000 bytes
3. Max byte between tags (to be transformed) is 200 bytes
